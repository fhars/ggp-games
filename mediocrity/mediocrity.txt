This game is a variant of Douglas Hofstader's "Mediocrity".  Each of
the three player choses a number from 0 to 8. If a player's number is
strictly between the other two numbers, this number is added to the
player's score. After five rounds, the player whose score is strictly
between the other player's scores is the winner.
