Some GGP Games
==============

This repository collects my experiments in writing games in GDL.

- bonaparte is a simplified version of diplomacy that will still most
  likely be far too complex for most players.

The `tests` subdirectory contains tests for these rules that can be
run in the [ggp-base](https://github.com/ggp-org/ggp-base) environment
by copying them into the appropriate subdirectory and linking the kif
files to games/test there.
