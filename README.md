Some GGP Games
==============

This repository collects my experiments in writing games in GDL.

- bonaparte is a simplified version of diplomacy that will still most
  likely be far too complex for most players. Someone called it
  "somewhat evil for your average general game player", but that is
  generous.
- mediocrity is a variant of Douglas Hofstadter's mediocrity.

The `tests` subdirectory contains tests for these rules that can be
run in the [ggp-base](https://github.com/ggp-org/ggp-base) environment
by copying them into the appropriate subdirectory and linking the kif
files to games/test there.
